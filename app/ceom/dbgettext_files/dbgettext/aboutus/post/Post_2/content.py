gettext("""The CEOM is one member of a multi-institution and international team for an interdisciplinary project \"Effects of anthropogenic habitat perturbation on rodent population dynamics and risk of rodent-borne diseases\". This 5-year project (2013-2018) will be carried out in Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay through close collaboration with a number of local institutions and researchers in these three countries. Institutional partners in USA are (1) Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, (2) University of Kansas, and (3) University of Oklahoma. The CEOM team will use geospatial technologies to characterize land use and land cover changes, and provide the resultant geospatial data to support spatial models in the project. The project is funded by the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) Collaborative Research Network (CRN3) program.""")
