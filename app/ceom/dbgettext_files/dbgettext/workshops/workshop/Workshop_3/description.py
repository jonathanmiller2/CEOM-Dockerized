gettext("""The 3rd international workshop on “community-based data synthesis, analysis and modeling of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI, H5N1 subtype) in Asia” will be held on November 14-15, 2011, Beijing, China. This 3rd workshop is a follow-up of the 2nd workshop (Beijing, China, May 31 – June 4, 2010) and the 1st workshop (Bangkok, Thailand, June 15-17, 2009). The overall objectives of this workshop series are twofold: (1) to identify and assemble available geospatial datasets relevant to HPAI (H5N1), and identify major gaps in data and models, which would assist prioritization of future research in data collection and models; and (2) to facilitate capacity building for a network of researchers and institutions, and infrastructure for data synthesis, analysis and modeling.
