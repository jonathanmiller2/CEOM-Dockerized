gettext("""Remote sensing technology at various platforms (in-situ, airborne and satellite) has made substantial progress over the past few decades and has been playing an increasing important role in observation and monitoring of the Planet Earth. This one-day workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and users in Oklahoma to communicate their research and application activities, discuss collaboration, and develop networks among researchers, users and students as well as institutions. Participants are also welcome to participate in the Geospatial Information Science Day (GISday) at the University of Oklahoma on November 13, 2014 (http://www.eomf.ou.edu/gisday/). Institutions are encouraged to register a booth at the GISday Expo event and showcase their research activities and/or needs in the area of remote sensing technology and applications.""")
