gettext("""In an effort to support citizen science and community remote sensing, CEOM developed and released the first android App \"Field Photo\", it is freely available to the public. See http://www.ceom.ou.edu/photos/ for more information and download it from Google Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ceom . The Field Photo App allows students, researchers and citizens to take photos during field trips, geotag them and add metadata and field notes to the photos. The field photos are then uploaded to the Global Geo-Referenced Field Photo Library at the University of Oklahoma, where people share, visualize and archive field photos that document land use and land cover change, flood, drought, fire, and so on. These photos and associated thematic databases are also used to support satellite image analyses for monitoring the dynamics of Planet Earth, where now more than seven billions of people live. The integration of mobile phone, Geo-Referenced Field Photo Library and satellite images allows us to socialize the pixels in the images.""")
