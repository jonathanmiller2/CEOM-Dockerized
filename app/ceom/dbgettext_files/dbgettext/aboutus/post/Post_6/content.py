gettext("""As part of a collaborative effort between OU Department of Microbiology and Plant Biology (DMPB), OU School of Meteorology (SoM), the Oklahoma Climatological Survey (OCS), and the USDA ARS Grazinglands Research Laboratory (GRL), two integrated grassland observation sites (iGOS) have recently been established at the USDA ARS Grazinglands Research Laboratory, EL Reno, Oklahoma. One iGOS site sits on native grasslands, which has never been cultivated, and the other iGOS site sits on improved pasturelands. Each site is equipped with an advanced eddy covariance tower system for measuring energy, carbon, water and methane fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere, a Phenocam to track plant phenology, and a COSMOS instrument to measure soil moisture at the landscape scale. In addition, hyperspectral, multispectral and thermal remote sensing measurements are routinely carried out at the sites. The iGOS sites are also co-located with the Oklahoma Mesonet El Reno site. This collaborative project has been supported by the NSF EPSCoR projects and USDA NIFA project and will carry out multiple year observations at the iGOS sites (up to 5 years with current NSF and USDA grants, and subsequently as part of the Southern Plains Long-term Agroecosystem Research Network).""")
