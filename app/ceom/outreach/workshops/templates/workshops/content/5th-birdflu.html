<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The 5th International Workshop on Highly Pathogenic Influenza Risk Assessment &amp; Risk Modeling: </strong><br /><strong>Transitioning from Global to Local Assessments</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">May 27-28 2013, Hanoi, Vietnam (Scientific Presentation / Discussion)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">May 29-31 2013, Red River Delta or northern Vietnam (Field Trip)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>I. Summary</strong></p>
<p>This workshop builds upon the 4 previous community-based data synthesis, analysis and modeling of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza workshops, which were coordinated by NIH, FAO and the University of Oklahoma; held in Bangkok, Thailand (2009), Beijing, China (2010, 2011), and Rome, Italy (2012). At the conclusion of the 4th workshop (November 2102) participants suggested that the broad scale, regional risk assessments and models developed to date may have limited applicability to national, provincial or local level issues related to influenza introduction, transmission and persistence. THe objective of the workshop to be held in May 2013 is to bring together multi-disciplinary international experts, national government representatives and experts, technical staff and other partners to explore disease risk factors at local levels. The desired outcome is to determine how influenza risk assessment and modeling should be pursued in order to capitalize on multi-disciplinary expertise and benefit national priority-setting for the prevention, response and control of HPAI.</p>
<p><strong>II. Objectives</strong></p>
<p>1. To review the factors that contribute to the epidemiological differences in HPAI clades in different regions of Asia;</p>
<p>2. To determine the factors that contribute to the epidemiological differences in HPAI clades in the northern Vietnam (Red River Delta) and southern Vietnam (Mekong Delta);</p>
<p>3. To discuss how influenza risk assessment and modeling should be pursued in Vietnam to benefit national priorities for the prevention, response and control of HPAI;</p>
<p>4. To discuss future potential research areas that would benefit responsible authorities in Vietnam, including but not limited to MARD, DAH, DLP, and MOH, and explore funding sources that would improve the control and management of influenza and other zoonotic diseases in Vietnam through risk assessment and analyses.</p>
<p><strong>III. Scope</strong></p>
<p>To achieve these objectives the wokrshop will include plenary presenations and discussion session focused on the following topics: (1) the current situation of HPAI H5N1 in Asia; (2) the current situation of HPAI H5Ni in Vietnam; (3) risk factors that may diffeerntiate the situation in northern Vietnam (Red River Delta) from southern Vietnam (Mekong Delta); (4) linking virology, phylogeny and spatial ecology with statistical models; and (5) opportunities to implement case studies.</p>
