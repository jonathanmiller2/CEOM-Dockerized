gettext("""This workshop builds upon the three previous community-based data synthesis, analysis and modeling of Highly 
Pathogenic Avian Influenza workshops, which were coordinated by NIH, FAO and University of Oklahoma since 2009. 
The focus of the workshop in November 2012 will bring together the experience and expertise arising from four 
different projects or initiatives, namely NIH, EPT+, CDC and FLURISK and it results from the interest shared by 
partners to better assess and model the potential risk of evolution and spread of pandemic influenza.   """)
