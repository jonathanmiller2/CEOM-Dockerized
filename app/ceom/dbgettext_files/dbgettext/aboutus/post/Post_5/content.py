gettext("""As part of the CEOMâ€™s effort to study the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus circulation in migratory wild bird populations across flyways, we use a number of new technologies to study bird migration and connectivity between wintering and breeding sites. In summer of 2013, Nyambayar Batbayar, a PhD student, conducted field studies in Mongolia and deployed a number of geo-light loggers on Barn Swallows and White-throated Bushchats, and cellular tracking and satellite transmitters on White-naped Cranes. On these projects, he is collaborating with Oklahoma Biological Survey, Oriental Bird Club, International Crane Foundation, US Forest Service, Poyang Lake Nature Reserve in China, Mongolian Academy of Sciences, and Wildlife Science and Conservation Center of Mongolia.""")
